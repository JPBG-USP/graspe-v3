# Introduction

This project was developed as part of an academic assignment during our undergraduate studies. The objective of the assignment was to design a robotic manipulator to solve a problem freely chosen by the students, applying the concepts learned throughout the course.

The Grasp-e project consists of a robotic manipulator designed to implement the thinning and harvesting technique in grapevines, with a special focus on table grapes.

This is the third version of Grasp-e, soon more information will be available.

# Python package

We also developed a Python package that includes a graphical interface to connect with the robot, simulation tools with control modules, real robot data analysis, and more.
You can learn more about it [here](./graspe_py/README.md)
