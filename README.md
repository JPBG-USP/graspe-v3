# Introduction

This project was developed as part of an academic assignment during our undergraduate studies. The objective of the assignment was to design a robotic manipulator to solve a problem freely chosen by the students, applying the concepts learned throughout the course.

The Grasp-e project consists of a robotic manipulator designed to implement the thinning and harvesting technique in grapevines, with a special focus on table grapes.

This is the third version of Grasp-e, soon more information will be available.
